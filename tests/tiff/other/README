Image butique-YA16.tif was created by
hugin's nona transformer from a 16bit grayscale
image resulting in a 16bit grayscale image
with transparency.
Image butique-YA8.tif is a downconversion
to 8bits per pixel by openening and saving
in gimp.

These images don't contain pixels with transition
transparency or anything interesting other than
being grayscale images with alpha.


The butique-YA{8,16}.tif images were created
by myself and are hereby released to the public
domain. Or whatever. Do anything you want with them.
